# About Me!
## Bio
I am a Software Engineer at Gusto in San Francisco, specializing in AI. Pursuing a Masters degree in CS, I take pride and operate at the intersection of engineering and research by being able to both build robust systems while staying deeply engaged with emerging concepts. I would say my "people driven" mentality fuels my passion for creating (and wanting to create) meaningful technology.
A few highlights of my experiences include: 
- Developing an internal AI tool at Gusto that delivers a more personalized and engaging experience for partner companies.
- Building an object typing tool that improves copy speeds for HP printer users.
- Automating Whitman College’s Opentrons OT2 robot to autonomously identify optimal reagent concentrations for synthesizing nanocrystals—empowering chemists with a valuable research tool.
